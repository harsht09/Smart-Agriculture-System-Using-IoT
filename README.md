# Smart Agricultural System - IoT

This repository consists of files required to set up an IoT system, based on an Arduino Yun board, which manages the automatic irrigation of a small vegetable garden, depending on the detection of environmental conditions (temperature, humidity & moisture) and the choice (by the user) of a particular crop to be managed. Notification of all the data and possible alarm situations through a dynamic and interactive web page and a e-mailing system. Arduino Yun works as a web server by locally hosting from the microSD card.
